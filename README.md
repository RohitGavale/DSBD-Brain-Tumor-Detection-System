# Brain Tumor Detection System using Python and Colab 


# Overview
This project is a Brain Tumor Detection System using the VGG16 model. The objective is to classify MRI images into categories indicating the presence or absence of a brain tumor. The system leverages deep learning for accurate image classification.


# Categories of Brain Tumor 

- **No Tumor:** MRI images with no signs of a tumor.

- **Pituitary Tumor:** A type of tumor that forms in the pituitary gland.

- **Glioma Tumor:** A tumor that originates in the glial cells of the brain or spine.

- **Meningioma Tumor:** A tumor that arises from the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.


# Dataset

The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle. It contains labeled MRI images for the above four categories.


# Technologies Used

- **Python:** Primary programming language for model training and data processing.

- **TensorFlow:** Open-source machine learning framework used for building and training deep learning models.

- **Keras:** High-level neural networks API, integrated with TensorFlow, used for constructing and training the VGG16 model.

- **VGG16:** A pre-trained convolutional neural network model used for image classification tasks through transfer learning.

- **NumPy:** Library for numerical computing, used for data manipulation and preprocessing.

- **Pandas:** Data analysis library used for organizing and analyzing MRI image data.

- **Matplotlib:** Visualization library used to plot graphs, training accuracy, and loss curves.

- **Google Colab:** Cloud-based platform used for training the model with GPU support.

- **Kaggle:** Platform where the MRI dataset was sourced, providing medical image data for model training.


# Conclusion

This Brain Tumor Detection System provides a reliable and efficient solution for early diagnosis of brain tumors using MRI images. With the use of transfer learning, it achieves high accuracy in classification.
